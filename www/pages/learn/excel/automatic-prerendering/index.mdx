Before Next.js 9, when you ran `next build`, server/serverless bundles would be created along with the client bundles. Then if you wanted to create static HTML versions of your pages you would need to run `next export`.

This could be sub-optimal if you need both dynamic and static pages. Since Next.js 9, `next build` comes with [Automatic Prerendering](https://nextjs.org/docs#automatic-prerendering) which can decide the build output per page, allowing your app to leverage static files and lambdas in the same app.

Before getting started, make sure you are using Next.js 9 or newer.

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
